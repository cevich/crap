CRAP: It's crass, ridiculous, and profound
==========================================

C'mon, it's an open-source project, you weren't looking for documentation were you?

This repo. contains a starting-point for learning the power of the force^H^H^H^HAnsible.

It was created for a workshop targed at Red Hat Quality-assurance engineering. `The
slide-deck <https://github.com/cevich/crap/raw/master/CRAP.pdf>`_ is intended for
those already moderately familiar with Ansible.  Otherwise if you're
a total noob, the following minimum prerequisites are recommended:

*  Watch from 3:24 - 10:33 - https://www.ansible.com/quick-start-video?wvideo=qrqfj371b6
*  Grok - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_reuse_roles.html
*  Skim - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_variables.html#variables
*  Skim - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_templating.html#templating-jinja2

Note:
    If you wish to actually understand most of the crap here, you'll probably want
    to grok all of those instead of skim.  Beyond that, playtime will be the best
    teacher:  Attempt the exercises at the end of
    `the slides <https://github.com/cevich/crap/raw/master/CRAP.pdf>`_.
